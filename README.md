# Moss-Plagarism-Checker
Java program to compare software similarity using MOSS

# What is MOSS
Moss (Measure Of Software Similarity) is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. To date, the main application of Moss has been in detecting plagiarism in programming classes. Since its development in 1994, Moss has been very effective in this role. The algorithm behind moss is a significant improvement over other cheating detection algorithms (at least, over those known to us).
MOSS is mainly used by institutes and websites for checking plagarism in competitive programming contests.
e.g. Hackerrank and Codechef.

# How to run?
Put files to check in a folder and provide its location in Moss.java 
then just run MOSS.java and make sure you have working internet
